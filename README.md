# MATLAB-Encryption-Decryption-Tool-Project
Engineering 102 (Spring 2020) Project 2

# Introduction
MATLAB code was produced in order to effectively encrypt and decrypt a secret message using the Vigenère, Running-key, Auto-key, Beaufort, and Porta ciphers. This work was necessary as it helped secure cyberspace, which was declared as one of the fourteen grand challenges of the 21st​ century by the National Academy of Engineering. 

# 1.1 Problem Statement
The problem faced in this project was to ensure that a user could safely transmit a secret message through cyberspace and whoever was on the receiving-end could successfully decrypt the message as well. The primary challenge of the project was to write code in MATLAB that could adequately encrypt and decrypt a message using various ciphers. Overarching issues included understanding how to determine the key for each of the particular ciphers.

There were several major objectives that were accomplished by conducting this project. The first objective was to conduct sufficient background research to better understand cryptography, cryptanalysis, and different encryption techniques. The next objective was to develop a MATLAB script that would compute an encrypted or decrypted message, depending on what the user wanted. Lastly, each cipher had to be analyzed to determine the most reliable encryption technique.
